        "Order 66 was programmed into the Grand Army clone troopers through behavioural modification biochips implanted into their brains, making it almost impossible for the clones to disobey the command to turn against their Jedi Generals.",
        "Dooku was taken by the Jedi Order after being abandoned by his family and became a Padawan of Yoda. The corruption in the Galactic Senate as well as certain traditions of the Jedi disillusioned him, and he eventually left the Order.",
        "Hoth was a remote, icy planet where temperatures fell to -60°C at night.",
        "Jango Fett was killed by Mace Windu on Geonosis. Fett attempted to flee from the Jedi using his jetpack but it had been damaged earlier, rendering him immobile.",
        "The Millennium Falcon was a modified version of a freighter ship. Its side-mounted cockpit and front-facing mandibles allowed it to push containers.",
        "The creation of the clone army was commissioned by a Jedi Master called Sifo-Dyas. Sifo-Dyas foresaw a coming war but felt that the Galactic Republic was underequipped, and so proposed his idea of a clone army. The proposal was rejected by the Jedi Council, but he pursued his idea in secret nonetheless. He was eventually killed and his plans were taken over by Darth Sidious, who modified the clones to recognise Order 66.",
        "Anakin Skywalker was born on Tatooine as the son of a slave who conceived a child without a father.",

        "The final duel took place on Mustafar, a volcanic planet where Palpatine had sent Anakin to kill the Separatist Council and end the Clone Wars. Anakin was confronted by Obi-Wan and Padmé but was convinced that they were his enemies, and thus the iconic duel began.",
        "Kashyyyk was a temperate jungle planet. The planet had three moons and no seasons due to a lack of axial tilt and a perfectly circular orbit.",
        "Thousands of years before the events of the Skywalker Saga, lightsaber crystals were used to indicate a Jedi's chosen class. Blue indicated a Jedi Guardian, a Jedi who used the Force on a more physical level. Green indicated a Jedi Consular, a Jedi who preferred to reflect on the mysteries of the Force. This distinction fell out of practice in later years, when most Jedi simply used whichever colour they preferred.",
        "Alderaan was destroyed as punishment for supporting the Rebel Alliance, and the Empire hoped that its destruction would prevent other worlds from also supporting the rebels.",
        "Darth Maul was a Zabrak born on the planet Dathomir. He secretly survived his iconic battle against Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, and became a powerful crime lord.",
        "As Jabba attempted to execute Luke Skywalker and his allies at the Sarlacc Pit, Leia choked him to death using a chain.",
