Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is just a simple project I made to help gain more experience with technologies that I'm interested in.


I started out by watching a youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu1so3pz4bA) on how to use figma and then tried to create some designs of my own, which you can view online [here](https://www.figma.com/file/xExvPHoxMmn3JjIZI5fieI/Quiz-App?node-id=0%3A1).

in the top left of the figma page to navigate through different pages of my designs.


I then started building the front-end using TypeScript and React, while also using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to help craft UI components. You can view my Storybook page online [here](https://tsquizproject-storybook.netlify.app/?path=/story/homepage-homecard--classical-music).


I probably built around half of the front-end before starting work on the back-end, which you can see [here](https://github.com/joshua-hs/quizappbackend). Using GraphQL was probably overkill for this project, but I used it anyway just to gain some more experience.


## Things I learned:
Even though this project was rather simple, I believe I learned a fair amount on a few things such as:
- Deeper understanding of React hooks
- Reducers
- Responsive design using MUI grid system
- CSS animations
- Node + GraphQL development
- Using tools such as figma and Storybook
- Using hosting providers
- TypeScript and eslint configuration


## Complete list of technologies and services used:

- React.js
- MUI
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Figma
- Storybook.js
- AWS (S3 buckets)
- Netlify
- Heroku
- ...and hella Google Search
