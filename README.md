Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a project I made that lets users take quizzes on three topics; Star Wars, Formula 1 and Marvel films*.

**looking back, the questions in the Formula 1 and Marvel sections are overly difficult... I made them for a friend of mine who's a hardcore fan of both!*
